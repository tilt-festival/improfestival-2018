Do you find it difficult to get out of your head and into your body? Do you find yourself judging yourself or your
improv colleagues during and/or after scenes? In Always With Pleasure we will discover ways to be kinder to ourselves
and acquire skills to learn how to play better. This three hour workshop will quickly delve deep into the root of
saying yes and enjoying the world created as a result. It will give you the chance to practice how to enjoy every
moment on (and off) stage with pleasure with scene and group work. Just as the clown experiences the world with
foolish joy, we will connect to our playful spirit and follow what feels good.
