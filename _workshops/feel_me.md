When you believe in emotions on stage, the audience also will.

The workshop is focused on creating believable positive and negative characters. You will
learn how to create strong, authentic and emotional relationships between partners. You
will learn how to find the balance in the scene, the critique point / the climax and the new
balance, which will make your scenes meaty, real and easy to believe.

Improve, discover and react!
