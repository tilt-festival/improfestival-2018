Improvisation is everything we have been, everything we are and everything
we hope to be.

Every time we climb on stage or speak in front of a group, we should risk
being vulnerable and revealing something of ourselves, and this should not
always feel comfortable.

When we first learn improv we seek to feel comfortable, to do things that
seem familiar and feel right. But as we grow as improvisers we need to
continually re-invent ourselves and push the boundaries of what is possible
for improv and for ourselves.

Extend your comfort zone and embrace chaos to explore comedy, tragedy and
the absurd, as Glenn pushes you to test your limits and beyond!

​Perfect for: intermediate and advanced improvisers
