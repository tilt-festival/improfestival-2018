People would tend to think improv is a blank page to be filled. To Flavien,
Improv is a page, already written in invisible ink that you only have to read.
Improv is not a creative effort, it's an ability of the artist to be present
and open enough to be the receptacle as well as the medium of Art.

In this class Flavien Reppert will give you Improv glasses to see everything.
You’ll read the scenes, the space, the objects and of course your partners.
Everything is already there, there's nothing to be created or invented.
There's just momentum to be revealed.

Perfect for: intermediate and advanced improvisers

Skills and Tools: Reading scenes/ slow improv / support
