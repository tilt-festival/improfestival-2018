You love to improvise - but want to take the next step? Sing about it!

Singing is one of the most challenging and rewarding skills in the improv arsenal.
Not only do you have to create something with your voice, you also collaborate with
a musician and dance with your scene partners.

In this class you will have the opportunity to learn easy tools to create great
songs - both solo and with your scene partners.

In Sing it out loud, you learn common song and dance structures that work together,
creating memorable musical numbers, and how to convincingly get into song and dance
from an improvised scene. You will also learn how to be a great backup singer and
dancer behind a solo singer.

This is a super-fun workshop for you who want to learn improvised singing!

Perfect for: beginning, intermediate and advanced improvisers.
