In rocketry, “Max Q” is the point where a rocket experiences the greatest amount of
pressure. In improv, it’s the point in a scene where you know what the scene’s about, but
don’t know what to do next. This is a diagnostics workshop where we find out how to
send a scene rocketing towards a satisfying ending.
