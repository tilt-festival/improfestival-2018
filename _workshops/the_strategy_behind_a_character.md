Occupation, wants and dreams are not the only things that define a character. Even
though we’re improvising it’s good to have a strategy for your character’s growth and
influence in the story you’re creating. The saying: “If you have a great character, the story
will find you” is absolutely true, but to develop a character that does not get stuck in the
plot twists can sometimes be devastating. In this workshop, we’ll create, research and
strengthen the characters.
