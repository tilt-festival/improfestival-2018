Improvisational theater comes in many forms and a lot of troupes specialize on a particular style. Some will talk
a lot during their scenes, others focus on silence in scenes, some groups love making small talk and others focus
purely on the relationships between the characters.

What would happen if you would change the style you are playing in the middle of the scene?

That is what you are going to discover in this workshop. The goal is to shift styles and speeds during the scene.
You will create dynamic scenes that can make small talk all of a sudden very important for the characters and switch
from talking heads into beautiful silent moments. Jochem will hand you an easy to remember system with which you can
consciously switch back and forth between styles for the good of the scene.
