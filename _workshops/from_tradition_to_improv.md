The session starts with some warm up including traditional games. It continues with the explanations of games
that we developed from traditional theater forms into improv; different storytelling styles and story building
with audience interaction. The main idea is creating simple games from traditional forms in order to enrich the
improvisational repertoire. The most important achievement of this workshop is asking questions about different
traditional forms and if they can be used in improv.
