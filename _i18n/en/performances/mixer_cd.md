_The sixth international improv festival Tilt is very proud to welcome improvisers from countries nearby and far away.
Because these participants are skillful at what they do, they are happy to engage in challenges that are bigger than
just improvising a performance on the spot!_

_On the day of the mixer show, improvisers with different backgrounds have met in a workshop and with the help of
the workshop instructor they have prepared the format that you will see on the same evening.
So it’s as fresh as it can be! Come to the performance and see how it all will turn out!_

### “Once Upon a Time”. Instructor: Koray Tarhan (TUR)

**The performance is in English.**

In this format we create the stories spontaneously in eight steps.
The format shares a universal story structure, which triggers both the improvisers’ and
the audience’s imagination, in an easy way by using visuals. The Improvisers and the audience experience the basics of long form and character building tips in a unique way. The improvisers will visualize the audience’s imagination by acting and singing.

Once Upon A Time format has been presented and performed in AIN San Francisco
Conference, Global Improvisation Initiative Conference in Los Angeles and Beijing, Ljubljana and Istanbul Improv Festivals.

### “In Silent”. Instructor: Morgan Mansouri (FRA)

**The performance is in mime - no speaking!**

In everyday life, what do we do when we want to express ourselves without the possibility to speak?
This show uses the art of mime and body language instead of dialogue, presenting the audience with a variety of situations, real ones or not, where language is not possible.
Players will explore ways of using the human body as a tool for comedy and storytelling through aspects of mime, clown, and physicality and learn to use them to effectively play scenes together on stage without relying heavily on dialogue.
