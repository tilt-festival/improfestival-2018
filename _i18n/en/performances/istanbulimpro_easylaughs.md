### Istanbulimpro (TUR) - “Stories Behind Rods And Shawls” 

**The performance is in English.**

Two improvisers, two rods, two shawls and an adventure of a hero.  
Two actors use rods and shawls as props, puppets or costumes to create a world of stories.  

Rod and shawl have been used in the unique storytelling technique of Anatolia named “Meddah” many many years ago. A dead tradition strikes back by the magic of improv.  

Koray Tarhan and Mahmut Fikirsindi bring you the “Stories Behind the Rods and Shawls”.

### easylaughs (NLD) - “Tarantino”

**The performance is in English.**

Wikipedia says it best: Quentin Tarantino is an American director, writer, and actor. His films are characterized by satirical subject matter, an aestheticization of violence, extended scenes of dialogue, ensemble casts consisting of established and lesser-known performers, references to popular culture, soundtracks primarily containing songs and score pieces from the 1960s to the 1980s, and features of neo-noir film. You will witness an improvised play in the style of his earlier work (Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs).
