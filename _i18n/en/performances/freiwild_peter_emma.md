### frei.wild Improvisationstheater Berlin (DEU) - “Lucky Losers”

**The performance is in English.**

Three buddies meet at their usual hangout. They have been friends for a long time, knowing each other’s strengths and flaws. Here they feel at home and discuss big and small matters. When not in their hideaway they struggle with their daily lives. They struggle hard - but not necessarily rationally in their quest for happiness. Does that seem familiar? The buddies stagger from funny to sad to bizarre and back. What’s pretty sure: In the end their friendship will not be the same as in the beginning.

frei.wild Improvisationstheater exists for over 11 years and has performed all over Europe. They try to find the funny in the situation, in the all-too-human, rather than by the help of gags. They work a lot with the surreal, dimensions, multiple layers and such. For that they are constantly looking for opportunities to make use of music, silence, physicality. They are not only fond of performing together, but as well of their friendship in real life - and struggle hard!!!
