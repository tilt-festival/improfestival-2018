_The sixth international improv festival Tilt is very proud to welcome improvisers from countries nearby and far away.
Because these participants are skillful at what they do, they are happy to engage in challenges that are bigger than
just improvising a performance on the spot!_

_On the day of the mixer show, improvisers with different backgrounds have met in a workshop and with the help of
the workshop instructor they have prepared the format that you will see on the same evening.
So it’s as fresh as it can be! Come to the performance and see how it all will turn out!_

### “Degrees of Separation”. Instructor: Kevin Miller (USA)

**The performance is in English.**

Look around the next time you’re in a room full of people. Any one of them might have a fascinating story to tell.

What if you could go along with them and learn it? In “Degrees of Separation,” an improvised story that seems to be
about one character will suddenly pivot to become about another… and then another… and then another.
There’s no single hero, just a complex web of scenes.

### “Follow the Leaver”. Instructor: Michaela Puchalková (CZE)

**The performance is in English.**

Inspired by the film Slacker. Just like in the 1991 independent film Slacker, this format is like one long
continuous camera shot following characters along to new locations and scenes.

Everything takes place more or less in real time and the only way to edit a scene is to follow a
character when he/she leaves one scene and enters a different one.
