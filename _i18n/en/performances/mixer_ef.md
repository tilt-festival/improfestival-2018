The sixth international improv festival Tilt is very proud to welcome improvisers from countries nearby and far away.
Because these participants are skillful at what they do, they are happy to engage in challenges that are bigger than
just improvising a performance on the spot!

On the day of the mixer show, improvisers with different backgrounds have met in a workshop and with the help of
the workshop instructor they have prepared the format that you will see on the same evening.
So it’s as fresh as it can be! Come to the performance and see how it all will turn out!

### “Devil’s Triangle”. Instructor: Katarzyna Chmara (POL)

**The performance is in English.**

“Devil’s Triangle” (better known as Bermuda Triangle) - the name of an improvised performance taken from the field of unearthly geography inspired from Fabio Maccioni. Inspired by these phenomena, the spectacle may be considered an event breaking the laws of physics, full of inexplicable strands of action, abstract elements and figures only inspired by reality. There is no one fixed shape of the spectacle, its form is spontaneously clarified. The audience will have a significant impact on its course, whose suggestions will be absorbed by the imagination of the improvisers... Each suggestion will be interpreted physically into what can also be called a mini choreography. This, in turn, will be an inspiration for the improvised scene.

### “Long-form Murder Mystery”. Instructor: Kayleigh Cassidy (GBR)

**The performance is in English.**

Long-form Murder Mystery may not be an interesting title…yet, but the form does what it says on the tin. It is a long form murder mystery! Students will work together as an ensemble, creating strong scene pictures while also developing archetypal characters through physical and vocal choices.  
At the beginning, the audience will offer suggestions for who, what and where. After, the show will begin with each scene established by a visual representation of the location. Once this is established alongside music (chosen by the audience) characters may enter and engage in the scene. Improvisers will play one character and lots of different objects. At the end of the show, the audience decides (by popular vote) who the killer is.
