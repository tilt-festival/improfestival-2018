### D I V A S (LVA) - “Five Minutes Later”

**The performance is in English**

In Latvian the word “DIVAS” is the feminine form of the number two, but of course, the performers also love
the English meaning “a usually glamorous and successful female performer or personality”.
Anete and Elīna will start their show with a truthful conversation about a topic that will be suggested by the audience.
After sharing experiences from their lives, the characters and stories that then pop up will demonstrate how they
feel about the world around them and their role in it.

D I V A S is an improv duo from Riga, Latvia. They have both been improvisers for about 9 years and
friends since forever, but somehow never played together. So, just recently they decided to change
that and perform only the two of them and it turned out that it was great so they kept on doing that.
With a lot of trust and support towards each other, they are exploring many formats, themes, genres and
seeing where their teamwork can go.

First friendship, then improv.

### Poulpe (FRA) - “(G)oldies”

**The performance is in English**

Are we waiting? Who for? What for? What do we fill our days with?

Poulpe Production offers, with the show "(G)OLDIES", the possibility to discover the daily life of seniors and
finally to restore the (their) truth. Together, we will discover (in an offbeat and humorous way) the place of
the "old people" in our society.

Two actors interpret sketches inspired by real testimonies, experienced by seniors in their daily environment.
They stage situations that are rich in lessons allowing everyone to take stock of their own knowledge and to
think about the many problems that anyone called "elderly" can come across.
Thanks to the techniques of theatrical improvisation, the environment and the scenario of the show are adapted to
the particular context of the structures.
