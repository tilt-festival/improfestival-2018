This workshop will prove that it is not necessary to speak to be able to create stories, to transmit emotions, and connect with your audience. In this workshop, you will learn a variety of tricks and techniques from the world of mime and clowning, and see how they can be used to create realistic objects and environments on stage.</p><hr><p>Morgan began theater when he was 9 years old…and never quit the stage.</p><p>He studied the art of theater and cinematography at school, then went to Paris to study at the acting school Cours Florent, where he discovered improv. He began to work in different classical theater companies as an actor, writer, producer, production manager, webmaster or technician and learned at the same time masks, dance, mime, sing, video, clown and many more to be the artist he is today.</p><p>In 2011-2018 he worked with the professional french improv company Impro Infini as an actor, producer and artistic director. He brought them all his knowledge and used it to create many shows and different workshops to convey his vision of the scene. At the same time, he was also the co-director of the International Improv Festival SUBITO!¡ in Brest. He has created many shows but has also played and trained with a lot of well-respected improv players like Randy Dixon, Patti Stiles, Joe Bill, Lee White, Felipe Ortiz, Inbal Lori, Nick Byrne, and many more… He has also travelled to teach, learn and play improv in different international improv festivals like Berlin IMPRO festival 2014, Seattle UP festival 2014, Würzburg Festival 2014/15, Amsterdam IMPRO 2016/18, Tampere FIIF 2016/17/18, Göteborg IMPROFEST 2016, WIP Piombino 17, Shiiink 17, Improovelicious 18 and Lyon Impro Fest 18. In 2018, wishing to emerge from the classical borders of improvisation and to take advantage of all his achievements, he founded a new multidisciplinary artistic group in France called POULPE PRODUCTION and now presents original creations at different improv festivals (like DECIBEL, BACKSTAGE or IMPORN).</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/decibelimpro" target="_blank">facebook.com/decibelimpro</a></li><li><a href="https://www.poulpeproduction.com/quoi/shows/g-oldies/" target="_blank">poulpeproduction.com/quoi/shows/g-oldies</a></li><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/PoulpeProduction" target="_blank">facebook.com/PoulpeProduction</a></li><li><a href="https://www.poulpeproduction.com" target="_blank">poulpeproduction.com</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></body></html>
