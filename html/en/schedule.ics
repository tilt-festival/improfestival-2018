Instructor: Kevin Miller (USA)The performance is in English.Look around the next time you’re in a room full of people. Any one of them might have a fascinating story to tell.What if you could go along with them and learn it? In “Degrees of Separation,” an improvised story that seems to beabout one character will suddenly pivot to become about another… and then another… and then another.There’s no single hero, just a complex web of scenes.“Follow the Leaver”. Instructor: Michaela Puchalková (CZE)The performance is in English.Inspired by the film Slacker. Just like in the 1991 independent film Slacker, this format is like one longcontinuous camera shot following characters along to new locations and scenes.Everything takes place more or less in real time and the only way to edit a scene is to follow acharacter when he/she leaves one scene and enters a different one.

SUMMARY:The Strategy Behind a Character
DESCRIPTION:Occupation, wants and dreams are not the only things that define a character. Eventhough we’re improvising it’s good to have a strategy for your character’s growth andinfluence in the story you’re creating. The saying: “If you have a great character, the storywill find you” is absolutely true, but to develop a character that does not get stuck in theplot twists can sometimes be devastating. In this workshop, we’ll create, research andstrengthen the characters.Kaspars Breidaks has studied and performed in The Second City, Chicago and represented Latvia in improv festivals in Denmark, Netherlands, Germany, Finland, Spain, France and Estonia. He hosts a daily morning show on Radio SWH in Riga, Latvia and performs every week in short and long form shows.

Come to the performance and see how it all will turn out!“Devil’s Triangle”. Instructor: Katarzyna Chmara (POL)The performance is in English.“Devil’s Triangle” (better known as Bermuda Triangle) - the name of an improvised performance taken from the field of unearthly geography inspired from Fabio Maccioni. Inspired by these phenomena, the spectacle may be considered an event breaking the laws of physics, full of inexplicable strands of action, abstract elements and figures only inspired by reality. There is no one fixed shape of the spectacle, its form is spontaneously clarified. The audience will have a significant impact on its course, whose suggestions will be absorbed by the imagination of the improvisers… Each suggestion will be interpreted physically into what can also be called a mini choreography. This, in turn, will be an inspiration for the improvised scene.“Long-form Murder Mystery”. Instructor: Kayleigh Cassidy (GBR)The performance is in English.Long-form Murder Mystery may not be an interesting title…yet, but the form does what it says on the tin. It is a long form murder mystery! Students will work together as an ensemble, creating strong scene pictures while also developing archetypal characters through physical and vocal choices.At the beginning, the audience will offer suggestions for who, what and where. After, the show will begin with each scene established by a visual representation of the location. Once this is established alongside music (chosen by the audience) characters may enter and engage in the scene. Improvisers will play one character and lots of different objects. At the end of the show, the audience decides (by popular vote) who the killer is.

They have been friends for a long time, knowing each other’s strengths and flaws. Here they feel at home and discuss big and small matters. When not in their hideaway they struggle with their daily lives. They struggle hard - but not necessarily rationally in their quest for happiness. Does that seem familiar? The buddies stagger from funny to sad to bizarre and back. What’s pretty sure: In the end their friendship will not be the same as in the beginning.frei.wild Improvisationstheater exists for over 11 years and has performed all over Europe. They try to find the funny in the situation, in the all-too-human, rather than by the help of gags. They work a lot with the surreal, dimensions, multiple layers and such. For that they are constantly looking for opportunities to make use of music, silence, physicality. They are not only fond of performing together, but as well of their friendship in real life - and struggle hard!!!  frei-wild-berlin.de  facebook.com/frei.wild.berlin  youtube.com/channel/UCbK359Tyaq4h5cjFONvVRZA  twitter.com/freiwildimproPeter More and Emma Wessleus (GBR) - “Mørdsäga”The performance is in English.In darkest Scandinavia a crime has been committed.

You will witness an improvised play in the style of his earlier work (Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs).easylaughs is an international improvised comedy group based in Amsterdam. Many of the players are full-time actors and theatre teachers and several of the cast have been playing together for more than 10 years. The cast includes voice actors, television presenters and writers and covers a wide international range with two Dutch, five British, an American, an Australian and a New Zealander.  easylaughs.nl
