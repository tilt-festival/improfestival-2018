It continues with the explanations of games that we developed from traditional theater forms into improv; different storytelling styles and story building with audience interaction. The main idea is creating simple games from traditional forms in order to enrich the improvisational repertoire. The most important achievement of this workshop is asking questions about different traditional forms and if they can be used in improv.</p><hr><p>Koray Tarhan graduated from Ankara University Theater Dept. in 2001.
