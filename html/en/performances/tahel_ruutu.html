How do stories happen? Two questions that have something in common: they both need experiencing and discovering. To do this, these two actors and long-time friends have only two chairs to help them. But that’s already more than enough.</p><hr><p>It doesn’t happen often today that friendships are made on a battlefield. Especially on the kind where armoured men fight each other with swords. But this was the place where this friendship began (true story). Now, years have passed and friendship has added layers in great cooperation and sensibility on stage. Rahel and Timo are like a positive nature catastrophe in all its sincere and natural being.</p><h3 id="ruutu10-est---a-conversation">Ruutu10 (EST) - “A Conversation”</h3><p><strong>The performance is in Estonian.</strong></p><p>Come, relax and let’s have a nice talk. Inspired by this they will bring you a dashing and funny improv comedy performance.</p><hr><p>They’ve learned improv comedy in Chicago, London, Barcelona, Copenhagen and Tampere under the best teachers of this craft and are now paying forward our knowledge. They work to raise the quality of local comedy. They have a dream that one day there will be a school and theatre in Estonia that is focused on improv and gives people the chance to relax and laugh wholeheartedly.</p><ul><li><a href="http://ruutu10.ee" target="_blank">ruutu10.ee</a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.com/ruutu10" target="_blank">facebook.com/ruutu10</a></li><li><a href="https://youtube.com/user/naervabastab" target="_blank">youtube.com/user/naervabastab</a></li><li><a href="https://instagram.com/ruutu10eesti" target="_blank">instagram.com/ruutu10eesti</a></li></ul></div></div></div></body></html>
