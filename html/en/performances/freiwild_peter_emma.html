They have been friends for a long time, knowing each other’s strengths and flaws. Here they feel at home and discuss big and small matters. When not in their hideaway they struggle with their daily lives. They struggle hard - but not necessarily rationally in their quest for happiness. Does that seem familiar? The buddies stagger from funny to sad to bizarre and back. What’s pretty sure: In the end their friendship will not be the same as in the beginning.</p><p>frei.wild Improvisationstheater exists for over 11 years and has performed all over Europe. They try to find the funny in the situation, in the all-too-human, rather than by the help of gags. They work a lot with the surreal, dimensions, multiple layers and such. For that they are constantly looking for opportunities to make use of music, silence, physicality. They are not only fond of performing together, but as well of their friendship in real life - and struggle hard!!!</p><ul><li><a href="https://frei-wild-berlin.de/" target="_blank">frei-wild-berlin.de</a></li><li><a href="https://de-de.facebook.com/frei.wild.berlin" target="_blank">facebook.com/frei.wild.berlin</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbK359Tyaq4h5cjFONvVRZA" target="_blank">youtube.com/channel/UCbK359Tyaq4h5cjFONvVRZA</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/freiwildimpro" target="_blank">twitter.com/freiwildimpro</a></li></ul><h3 id="peter-more-and-emma-wessleus-gbr---mørdsäga">Peter More and Emma Wessleus (GBR) - “Mørdsäga”</h3><p><strong>The performance is in English.</strong></p><p>In darkest Scandinavia a crime has been committed. Only Scanadanvias toppest and most quirkiest detectives can solve it. A fjord-filled, Crime, Comedy Moostery. Comedy Duo Peter More and Emma Wessleus take you with them along the trail of the perpetrators of the crime as well as into the complicated lives of the detectives. The show is inspired by Nordic Noir hits such as The Killing, The Bridge, and The Naked Gun.</p><p>Peter More and Emma Wessleus met in Amsterdam and were both members of the easylaughs and Opro - Improvised Opera. They are both improvisers and stand-ups, but Emma wins because she is also an opera singer. Between them they can reach the high notes and the low brows. Between them they have 25 years of performing experience.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Mordsaga/" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/Mordsaga/</a></li></ul></div></div></div></body></html>
