People, torn out of the environment they knew before. No comforts. No need to hold on to social norms established so far. And still, they are influenced by everything that has already been. Jaa !mproteater brings you stories of people who have to manage unexpectedly in unknown conditions. They will be forced to fight the world outside but also others around them and sometimes even themselves. Who or what will prevail will be uncovered on the theatre stage.</p><hr><p>Jaa !mprov theatre has brought good short- and long-form improvisation to the audience for already almost ten seasons. Our goal is to offer ways of connecting with the show either through laughter, acknowledgement or viewpoints that you wouldn’t expect. Everything that happens on the stage is improvised, every performance is unique and it all depends on you - the good audience!</p><ul><li><a href="https://jaa.ee" target="_blank">jaa.ee</a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.com/jaaimproteater" target="_blank">facebook.com/jaaimproteater</a></li><li><a href="https://instagram.com/jaaimproteater" target="_blank">instagram.com/jaaimproteater</a></li></ul><h3 id="improteater-impeerium-est---romantic-comedy">Improteater IMPEERIUM (EST) - “Romantic Comedy”</h3><p><strong>The performance is in Estonian.</strong></p><p>Romantic comedy is a genre that has made audiences laugh and touched them in theatre halls and on movie screens. The improvised performance tells a story about something that touches all of us - love. It brings us sincere, romantic and affectionate stories of relationships that have been inspired by life itself with its hidden beauty and pain. And as we all know those situations can also have their comic side.</p><hr><p>Improv theater IMPEERIUM (Empire) grew out of the first Estonian professional improv group in 2014. The group has already almost 10 years of improv experience. The members of the group are all professional actors, who in addition to being members of IMPEERIUM, are also part of drama groups in other Estonian theaters or work as freelancers in various theater, television and film projects. In addition to actors, there are also musicians and lighting designers in the group, who help to spread the love for improv in Estonia. The word “imperium” in Latin means “power”. The goal of improv theatre IMPEERIUM is to conquer the hearts of all Estonians and create another country filled with improv joy, where people value cooperation and creativity and that is ruled by the power of imagination.</p><h4 id="troupe">Troupe</h4><p>Actors: Merilin Kirbits, Kati Ong, Mairi Tikerpalu, Maarika Mesipuu-Veebel, Tarvo Krall, Rauno Kaibiainen, Erki Aule, Maarius Pärn.
