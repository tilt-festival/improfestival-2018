Anete and Elīna will start their show with a truthful conversation about a topic that will be suggested by the audience. After sharing experiences from their lives, the characters and stories that then pop up will demonstrate how they feel about the world around them and their role in it.</p><hr><p>D I V A S is an improv duo from Riga, Latvia. They have both been improvisers for about 9 years and friends since forever, but somehow never played together. So, just recently they decided to change that and perform only the two of them and it turned out that it was great so they kept on doing that. With a lot of trust and support towards each other, they are exploring many formats, themes, genres and seeing where their teamwork can go.</p><p>First friendship, then improv.</p><h3 id="poulpe-fra---goldies">Poulpe (FRA) - “(G)oldies”</h3><p><strong>The performance is in English</strong></p><p>Are we waiting?

They stage situations that are rich in lessons allowing everyone to take stock of their own knowledge and to think about the many problems that anyone called “elderly” can come across. Thanks to the techniques of theatrical improvisation, the environment and the scenario of the show are adapted to the particular context of the structures.</p><hr><p>POULPE PRODUCTION aims at: educating, developing, and promoting cultural and social activities in various spaces: the street, theaters, popular education institutions, schools, businesses… The means of action of POULPE PRODUCTION are notably the use of multidisciplinary means such as: dramas, radio, video, photo, music, literature … and all the other disciplines that one does not master … but which amuse us!</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.poulpeproduction.com/quoi/shows/g-oldies/" target="_blank">poulpeproduction.com/quoi/shows/g-oldies</a></li><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/PoulpeProduction" target="_blank">facebook.com/PoulpeProduction</a></li><li><a href="https://www.poulpeproduction.com" target="_blank">poulpeproduction.com</a></li></ul></div></div></div></body></html>
